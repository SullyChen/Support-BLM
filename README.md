# Support-BLM
A python script to generate ad money for the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement

# What is this?
Recently a [video](https://youtu.be/bCgLa25fDHM) was released intending to raise money for BLM. Unfortunately, YouTube's algorithm will often mark video views as spam if the video is simply replayed over and over, or opened many times at once.

This script implements the "5/+/r/3/a/m" method of YouTube randomization to maximize ad revenue.

# How to use on Windows
For Windows users, download and unzip the blm_windows_exe.zip file, then run "blm_script.exe" and that's it! HUGE shoutout to [Brent Vollebregt](https://github.com/brentvollebregt/auto-py-to-exe), who made the code to turn any .py file into a Windows executable. Incredible work which allowed this project to be easier to use on Windows!

# For Mac/Linux
Unfortunately, I haven't yet been able to make a Mac or Linux executable file. To run this, [download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), then in a [terminal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QROX039ckO8), type `pip install youtube-search`. Finally, you can run the `blm_script.py` which is included in this repository.
